# PythonSPLA
This project was created to show Machine Learning by Simple Perceptron Learning Algorithm. The app was written in python with tkinter and NumPy. First you need to press "Learn" button and then you can draw number or just choose it from listed ones. Next you can click "check" to see the result of the Neural Network. You can always press "Learn" several times to train it better but be careful not to over train it. There is also an option to train it by modifications of SPLA which are PLA and RPLA.
